            <h5 class="fw-bold">The Start-up adventure</h5>
            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">August 2022</p>
            <p>
                We humans are difficult to satisfy—I'm no exception. In 2022, my frustration for not feeling I was
                "contributing to something meaningful (project/product-wise)" was fueled by an offer I received from a
                Startup based in Vancouver to work on a brand-new product they were developing. I talked to the product
                founders, underwent several interviews, and met the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's when I decided I'd join
                <a href="https://www.uncommonpurpose.com/" target="_blank">UncommonPurpose</a>
                in this new adventure. I resigned from my previous position, and after the notice period finished, I
                started to work remotely with the <a href="https://www.notimo.io/about" target="_blank">Notimo team</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Continuing with my focus on backend development, here, my main duties were designing, reviewing,
                developing, testing, and maintaining product features as a <strong>Backend Java Developer</strong>.
                Additionally, on a daily basis, I collaborated with the Director of Engineering, Product Owner, and the
                rest of the team in defining roadmaps and requirements, planning releases, and participating in other
                scrum-related activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the company decided to wind down the project. It was a difficult moment for the whole team,
                which had invested an enormous amount of energy and effort into making the user experience the best
                possible.

            <h5 class="fw-bold">Tick42</h5>
            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">June 2020</p>
            <p>
                Everything was going quite well so far, except for two things: I started to feel like I was doing a
                "code monkey" job, and I was barely making ends meet (now in a different country/market/cost of living).
            </p>
            <p>
                This is when I decided to explore the market in Bulgaria. Luckily, someone recommended Tick42 (now
                <a href="https://interop.io/" target="_blank">interop.io</a>). I had a couple of interviews with them,
                and in less than a week, I received a nice offer from them.
            </p>
            <p>
                My time at Tick42 was immensely rewarding, surrounded by highly skilled developers and excellent
                managers. Occasionally, I had the opportunity to lead a small team, and many times I mentored other
                developers in my area of expertise, which, by this time, was Backend Development with Java and the
                Spring ecosystem. I had the opportunity to learn directly from the top management and technical leaders
                and got involved in projects where I had to interact directly with our clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of my daily job, I had to design, develop, test, and maintain backend features using
                <strong>Java</strong>, running on top of <strong>Spring Boot</strong>. I also designed and implemented
                business metrics using Java, <strong>Prometheus</strong>, and <strong>Grafana</strong>. As is typical in
                our profession, I participated in scrum activities and CI/CD processes as part of a multicultural agile
                team.

            <h5 class="fw-bold">Moved abroad to work for Musala Soft</h5>
            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">April 2019</p>
            <p>
                By 2018, I was feeling stuck and making little progress in my career path. I decided to look for
                opportunities abroad, now with 4 years of professional experience under my belt.
            </p>
            <p>
                In November of that year, I received an offer from
                <a href="https://www.musala.com/" target="_blank">Musala Soft</a>, and by the end of March 2019, I had
                moved to Bulgaria. I officially started working in April.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Musala, I designed, developed, and tested product features using <strong>TypeScript</strong>/JavaScript
                and <strong>Java</strong>. I participated in pair programming with awesome colleagues from whom I
                learned a lot. I engaged in daily scrum activities, planning, refinement, retrospective sessions, and
                knowledge-sharing sessions as part of an agile development team.

            <p>
                My team was located in Havana and worked closely with our colleagues in Montevideo to provide product

                Securing my first job at
                <a href="https://www.uci.cu/en" target="_blank">Universidad de las Ciencias Informáticas</a>
                as a professional software engineer after graduating from university was an exhilarating experience.
                The opportunity to apply the knowledge gained during my studies in a real-world setting was
                immensely rewarding. I was filled with excitement and enthusiasm to embark on this new chapter in my
                career, eager to contribute my skills and learn from seasoned professionals in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                This milestone marked the transition from academia to the professional realm, and I was thrilled to
                embark on this journey of growth and development in the software engineering industry. There, I had the
                responsibility of designing, developing, and maintaining two APIs, using <strong>Java</strong> and
                <strong>PHP</strong>, to integrate clients with an in-house developed reports server.
