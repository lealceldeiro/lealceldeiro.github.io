            <p class="text-muted">
                By 2018 I was feeling stuck and making little progress in my career path. I decided to look
                for opportunities abroad, now with 4 years of professional experience under my belt.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                By November of that year I got an offer from
                <a href="https://www.musala.com/" target="_blank">Musala Soft</a>
                , and by the end of May 2019 I had moved to Bulgaria. I started to work officially on April.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                At Musala, I designed, developed and tested product features, using <strong>TypeScript</strong>/
                <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>Java</strong>.
                <br/>
                I participate in peer programming with awesome colleagues, from who I learned a lot, daily scrum
                activities, planning, refinement, retrospective, and knowledge-sharing sessions as part of an agile
                development team.

                It wasn't until I started at

                that I knew how demanding the software industry can be. Throughout my time here, I worked on three
                products

                commercialized mainly in Uruguay and Paraguay.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                My team was located in Havana and worked closely with our colleagues in Montevideo to provide product
                updates and release. During this time, I designed and develop many of these products' features, using
                <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>Groovy</strong>.

                as a professional software engineer after graduating from university was an exhilarating experience.
                The opportunity to apply the knowledge gained during my studies in a real-world setting was
                immensely rewarding. I was filled with excitement and enthusiasm to embark on this new chapter in my
                career, eager to contribute my skills and learn from seasoned professionals in the field.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                This milestone marked the transition from academia to the professional realm, and I was thrilled to
                embark on this journey of growth and development in the software engineering industry. There, I had the
                responsibility of designing, developing, and maintaining two APIs, using <strong>Java</strong> and
                <strong>PHP</strong>, to integrate clients with an in-house developed reports server.
