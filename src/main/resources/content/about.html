    If I were to put my professional life on a timeline, this would be it:
</p>

<section class="py-3 text-muted">
    <ul class="timeline-with-icons">

            <h5 class="fw-bold">Tick42</h5>
            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">June 2020</p>
            <p>
                Everything was going quite well so far, except two things: I started to feel I was doing a "code monkey"
                job, and I was barely making ends meets (now in a different country/market/cost of living).
            </p>
            <p>
                This is when I decided to explore the market in Bulgaria. And lucky me! Someone recommended Tick42
                (now <a href="https://interop.io/" target="_blank">interop.io</a>). I had a couple of interviews with
                them and in less than a week I got a nice offer from them.
            </p>
            <p>
                My time at Tick42 was immensely rewarding, surrounded by highly skilled developers and excellent
                managers. Occasionally I had the opportunity to lead a small team and many times I mentored other
                developers in my area of expertise, which, by this time, was Backend Development with Java and the
                Spring ecosystem. I got the opportunity to learn directly from the top management and
                technical leaders and got my hands on projects where I had to interact directly with our clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of my daily job I had to design, develop, test, and maintain back-end features using
                <strong>Java</strong>, running on top of <strong>Spring Boot</strong>. Design and implement business
                metrics, using Java, <strong>Prometheus</strong>, and <strong>Grafana</strong>. And as usual as it is in
                our profession I had to participate in scrum activities and CI/CD processes, as part of a multicultural
                agile team.

            <h5 class="fw-bold">Moved abroad to work for Musala Soft</h5>
            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">April 2019</p>
            <p>
                By 2018 I was feeling stuck and making little progress in my career path. I decided to look
                for opportunities abroad, now with 4 years of professional experience under my belt.
            </p>
            <p>
                By November of that year I got an offer from
                <a href="https://www.musala.com/" target="_blank">Musala Soft</a>
                , and by the end of March 2019 I had moved to Bulgaria. I started to work officially on April.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Musala, I designed, developed and tested product features, using <strong>TypeScript</strong>/
                <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>Java</strong>.
                <br/>
                I participate in peer programming with awesome colleagues, from who I learned a lot, daily scrum
                activities, planning, refinement, retrospective, and knowledge-sharing sessions as part of an agile
                development team.

            <h5 class="fw-bold">First time working at an international company</h5>
            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">August 2016</p>
            <p>
                It wasn't until I started at
                <a href="https://www.isaltda.com.uy/inicio" target="_blank">
                    ISA - Soluciones en Software
                </a>
                that I knew how demanding the software industry can be. Throughout my time here, I worked on three
                products

                commercialized mainly in Uruguay and Paraguay.
            </p>
            <p>
                My team was located in Havana and worked closely with our colleagues in Montevideo to provide product
                updates and release. During this time, I designed and develop many of these products' features, using
                <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>Groovy</strong>.

            <h5 class="fw-bold">Got my first job</h5>
            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">June 2014</p>
            <p>
                Securing my first job at
                <a href="https://www.uci.cu/en" target="_blank">Universidad de las Ciencias Inform√°ticas</a>
                as a professional software engineer after graduating from university was an exhilarating experience.
                The opportunity to apply the knowledge gained during my studies in a real-world setting was
                immensely rewarding. I was filled with excitement and enthusiasm to embark on this new chapter in my
                career, eager to contribute my skills and learn from seasoned professionals in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                This milestone marked the transition from academia to the professional realm, and I was thrilled to
                embark on this journey of growth and development in the software engineering industry. There, I had the
                responsibility of designing, developing, and maintaining two APIs, using <strong>Java</strong> and
                <strong>PHP</strong>, to integrate clients with an in-house developed reports server.

            <p>
                I was extremely excited to have received my

                    <em>university diploma</em>
                </a> from "Universidad de las Ciencias Inform&aacute;ticas", Havana, Cuba. The culmination of 5
                years of hard work and dedication resulted in an immense sense of accomplishment and pride.
                Obtaining this credential marked a significant milestone in my academic journey, representing the
                knowledge and skills I've acquired throughout my studies.
