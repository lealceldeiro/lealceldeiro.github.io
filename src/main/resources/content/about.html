            <h5 class="fw-bold">The Start-up adventure</h5>
            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">August 2022</p>
            <p>
                We humans are difficult to satisfyâ€”I'm no exception. In 2022, my frustration for not feeling I was
                "contributing to something meaningful (project/product-wise)" was fueled by an offer I received from a
                Startup based in Vancouver to work on a brand-new product they were developing. I talked to the product
                founders, underwent several interviews, and met the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's when I decided I'd join
                <a href="https://www.uncommonpurpose.com/" target="_blank">UncommonPurpose</a>
                in this new adventure. I resigned from my previous position, and after the notice period finished, I
                started to work remotely with the <a href="https://www.notimo.io/about" target="_blank">Notimo team</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Continuing with my focus on backend development, here, my main duties were designing, reviewing,
                developing, testing, and maintaining product features as a <strong>Backend Java Developer</strong>.
                Additionally, on a daily basis, I collaborated with the Director of Engineering, Product Owner, and the
                rest of the team in defining roadmaps and requirements, planning releases, and participating in other
                scrum-related activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the company decided to wind down the project. It was a difficult moment for the whole team,
                which had invested an enormous amount of energy and effort into making the user experience the best
                possible.

            <h5 class="fw-bold">Tick42</h5>
            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">June 2020</p>
            <p>
                Everything was going quite well so far, except for two things: I started to feel like I was doing a
                "code monkey" job, and I was barely making ends meet (now in a different country/market/cost of living).
            </p>
            <p>
                This is when I decided to explore the market in Bulgaria. Luckily, someone recommended Tick42 (now
                <a href="https://interop.io/" target="_blank">interop.io</a>). I had a couple of interviews with them,
                and in less than a week, I received a nice offer from them.
            </p>
            <p>
                My time at Tick42 was immensely rewarding, surrounded by highly skilled developers and excellent
                managers. Occasionally, I had the opportunity to lead a small team, and many times I mentored other
                developers in my area of expertise, which, by this time, was Backend Development with Java and the
                Spring ecosystem. I had the opportunity to learn directly from the top management and technical leaders
                and got involved in projects where I had to interact directly with our clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of my daily job, I had to design, develop, test, and maintain backend features using
                <strong>Java</strong>, running on top of <strong>Spring Boot</strong>. I also designed and implemented
                business metrics using Java, <strong>Prometheus</strong>, and <strong>Grafana</strong>. As is typical in
                our profession, I participated in scrum activities and CI/CD processes as part of a multicultural agile
                team.

            <h5 class="fw-bold">Moved abroad to work for Musala Soft</h5>
            <p class="mb-2 fw-bold">April 2019</p>
            <p>
                By 2018, I was feeling stuck and making little progress in my career path. I decided to look for
                opportunities abroad, now with 4 years of professional experience under my belt.
            </p>
            <p>
                In November of that year, I received an offer from
                <a href="https://www.musala.com/" target="_blank">Musala Soft</a>, and by the end of March 2019, I had
                moved to Bulgaria. I officially started working in April.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Musala, I designed, developed, and tested product features using <strong>TypeScript</strong>/JavaScript
                and <strong>Java</strong>. I participated in pair programming with awesome colleagues from whom I
                learned a lot. I engaged in daily scrum activities, planning, refinement, retrospective sessions, and
                knowledge-sharing sessions as part of an agile development team.

                My team was located in Havana and worked closely with our colleagues in Montevideo to provide product

                Securing my first job at
                <a href="https://www.uci.cu/en" target="_blank">Universidad de las Ciencias InformÃ¡ticas</a>
                as a professional software engineer after graduating from university was an exhilarating experience.
                The opportunity to apply the knowledge gained during my studies in a real-world setting was
                immensely rewarding. I was filled with excitement and enthusiasm to embark on this new chapter in my
                career, eager to contribute my skills and learn from seasoned professionals in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                This milestone marked the transition from academia to the professional realm, and I was thrilled to
                embark on this journey of growth and development in the software engineering industry. There, I had the
                responsibility of designing, developing, and maintaining two APIs, using <strong>Java</strong> and
                <strong>PHP</strong>, to integrate clients with an in-house developed reports server.
