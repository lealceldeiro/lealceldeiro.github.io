Java API for RESTful web services (JAX-RS) aims to make development of RESTful web services in Java simple and
intuitive.

== Chapter 1: Introduction to REST

Architectural principles of the REpresentational State Transfer (REST):

* Addressable resources
* A uniform, constrained interface
* Representation-oriented
* Communicate statelessly
* Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS)

Example of an HTTP request performed by the browser:

[source,console]
----
GET /resteasy HTTP/1.1
Host: jboss.org
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language:
en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding:
gzip,deflate
----

To the previous request the response could be:

[source,console]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Servlet 2.4; JBoss-4.2.2.GA
Content-Type: text/html
<head>
<title>JBoss RESTEasy Project</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>JBoss RESTEasy</h1>
<p>JBoss RESTEasy is an open source implementation of the JAX-RS specification...
----

URI characters are encoded following these rules:

* The characters `a–z`, `A–Z`, `0–9`, `.`, `-`, `*`, and `_` remain the same
* The space character is converted to `+`
* The other characters are first converted into a sequence of bytes using a specific encoding scheme.
Next, a two-digit hexadecimal number prefixed by `%` represents each byte

`GET` is a read-only operation.
It is used to query the server for specific information.
It is both an idempotent and safe operation.

`PUT` requests that the server store the message body sent with the request under the location provided in the HTTP
message.
It is usually modeled as an insert or update and it's also idempotent.

`DELETE` is used to remove resources.
It is idempotent as well.

`POST` is non-idempotent and unsafe operation.
Each POST method is allowed to modify the service in a unique way.
We may or may not send information with the request.
We may or may not receive information from the response.

`HEAD` is exactly like `GET` except that instead of returning a response body, it returns only a response code and
any headers associated with the request.

`OPTIONS` is used to request information about the communication options of the resource we're interested in.
It allows the client to determine the capabilities of a server and a resource without triggering any resource action
or retrieval.

In a RESTful system, the complexity of the client-server interaction is within the representations being passed
back and forth.
These representations could be XML, JSON, YAML, or any other format designed for this purpose.

HTTP uses the `Content-Type` header to tell the client or server what data format it is receiving.
Its value string is in the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) format.
The MIME format is basic: `type/subtype;name=value;name=value...`.
For example:
[source,console]
----
text/plain
text/html
application/xml
text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
