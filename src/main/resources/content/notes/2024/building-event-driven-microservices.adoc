== Chapter 1: Why Event-Driven Microservices

Domain: The problem space that a business occupies and provides solutions to.
This encompasses everything that the business must contend with, including rules, processes, ideas,
business-specific terminology, and anything related to its problem space,
regardless of whether or not the business concerns itself with it.
The domain exists regardless of the existence of the business.

Domain (and subdomain) model: An abstraction of the actual domain useful for business purposes.
The main domain model of ana business is discernible through the products the business provides its customers,
the interfaces by which customers interact with the products, and the various other processes and functions by
which the business fulfills its stated goals.

By keeping loose coupling between bounded contexts, and focusing on minimizing inter-context dependencies,
we allow bounded context implementations to change as necessary,
without subsequently breaking many (or any) other systems.
