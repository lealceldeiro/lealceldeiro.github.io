Publishing our artifacts to Maven Central can be useful sometimes, especially if it's a utility library or
some code that can be re-utilized by the community.
In this article we'll go over the steps to publish such artifacts to the new Maven Central Repository.

== Is there a new Maven Central Repository?

When we were looking for a project dependency, we used to go to https://mvnrepository.com/[mvnrepository.com^].
Likewise, when we wanted to register ourselves as a publisher for the OSS Repository Hosting (OSSRH), we would do it
via the Sonatype OSSRH
(https://www.sonatype.com/blog/what-publishers-need-to-know-about-migrating-from-jcenter-/-bintray-to-the-central-repository[ref^]).

But after
https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/[JFrog sunsetting Bintray/JCenter^],
there was a
https://www.sonatype.com/blog/what-publishers-need-to-know-about-migrating-from-jcenter-/-bintray-to-the-central-repository[migration to the Central Repository^].

This means that starting on March 12th, 2024
https://central.sonatype.org/register/central-portal/[new users registration will be possible through the new portal^].
And new artifacts published this way will be available at https://central.sonatype.com/[central.sonatype.com^]

This doesn't mean if we're using a dependency available at https://mvnrepository.com/[mvnrepository.com^]
it'll stop working for us.
The team making all this possible has been
https://www.sonatype.com/blog/dear-bintray-and-jcenter-users-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-central-repository[very committed^]
to keeping the developer experience as good as possible, and we can use any dependency published in either repository,
and it will be resolved for us transparently.

== Requirements

That being said, how can we register ourselves as publishers?

How do we start publishing our artifacts to the Maven Central Repository?

At a high level, you need to meet these minimum requirements:

- Have an account in a version control system (VCS) and the source code hosted in such a VCS
- Have an account in Maven Central
- Being able to prove domain ownership, OR your personal domain from a code hosting service
- Have a GPG key (or similar) to sign the artifacts

The actual list of detailed/low-level requirements is being kept up to date at the
https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/[Maven Central Repository requirements^].

== Preparatory work

Let's use as an example this project:
https://github.com/lealceldeiro/com.lealceldeiro.asciidoc-extensions[`com.lealceldeiro.asciidoc-extensions`^].

=== Host the source code in a VCS

There are several options out there for us to host our source code, being GitHub and GitLab two popular ones.

For the time being, let's go with GitHub and https://github.com/signup[create an account^] if not already created.
Then, the code can be
https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github[pushed^]
to a newly created repository for that account.
The repository for the example project for this article can be checked
https://github.com/lealceldeiro/com.lealceldeiro.asciidoc-extensions[here^].

[TIP]
====
For people without experience hosting the source code in a VCS there are plenty of useful articles out there that
could be of use.
For the sake of conciseness, we'll focus on this article in the publication to the Maven Central Repository part.
====

=== Account in Maven Central

Now, let's go and https://central.sonatype.org/register/central-portal/#create-an-account[create an account^] in
Maven Central Repository if not already created.

After this, the next step is to validate our domain to be able to create a namespace and choose our artifact
https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/coordinates/#sufficient-metadata[coordinates^].

[TIP]
====
If you don't own a domain, don't worry, "personal domains" provided by Code Hosting Services
https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/coordinates/#supported-code-hosting-services-for-personal-groupid[can be used as well^].

For example: `lealceldeiro.github.io` could be used for the coordinate `io.github.lealceldeiro`.
====

Next, let's create a namespace.
To do this, go to https://central.sonatype.com/[central.sonatype.com^] and hit the "Sign" button
(notice this URL ends in `.com`, not `.org`)
and follow the https://central.sonatype.org/register/namespace/#choose-your-coordinates[official instructions^] to
create it and https://central.sonatype.org/register/namespace/#verifying-a-namespace[verify it^].
This is the step where we need to prove we "own" the domain we'll use for our artifact coordinates.

It will take some time for the verification to be completed. But once it's done, we're almost ready to get to the fun part.

=== GPG key

Having a https://gnupg.org/[GPG^] key generated for us as developers has many advantages.
This includes having the ability to sign artifacts so others know they were,
in fact, generated by us and not tampered with along the way until they're received by the final user/dev.

This article doesn't cover the details of generating the key.
But there are excellent articles out there with each step for it, including
https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg/[this one from the Maven Central Documentation^] and
this one from the GitHub documentation:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key[Generating a new GPG key^].

[IMPORTANT]
====
One of the most common mistakes developers do in this step is generating their keys but forgetting distributing
the public keys, so others can use them to verify the authenticity of the artifacts.
This item from the Maven Central documentation shows how to do it:
https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg/#distributing-your-public-key[Distributing Your Public Key^].

If we forget this step, the artifact publication would fail as there's no way Maven Central can verify the authenticity
of our artifacts.
That's why it's described as one of the https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/#sign-files-with-gpgpgp[requirements^].
====

== Publishing Options

Once the namespace is verified and the rest of the pre-requisites are ready,
we have these options to publish the actual artifact(s):

- By using the Maven Central https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-upload/#introduction[web interface^]
- By using the https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-api/[Portal Publisher API^]
- By using the Maven Central https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-maven/[Maven Plugin^]
- By using a https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-gradle/#introduction[Gradle plugin^]

Depending on each case, we may choose one or the other.
For example, if we want to do some quick tests, or we don't
plan to make many releases of the artifact, we may go with the web interface approach.
For developers who use Gradle already in their projects, the Gradle plugin would make perfect sense.

In this case we're going to use the https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-maven/[Maven Plugin^].
To do it we just need to add this to our project's `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.sonatype.central</groupId>
          <artifactId>central-publishing-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${central-publishing-maven-plugin.version}</version>
          <extensions>true</extensions>
          <configuration>
            <publishingServerId>central</publishingServerId>
          </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
----

We could add some
https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-maven/#plugin-configuration-options[more configuration options^]
to the previous snippet, depending on our needs.
For example, https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-maven/#automatic-publishing[_Automatic Publishing_^]
and https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-maven/#wait-for-publishing[_Wait for Publishing_^].

== Finishing up our Publishing Set up

There are two more steps we need to complete before our artifacts can be accepted by Maven Central:

- Generate our artifact's
https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-maven/#javadoc-and-sources-attachments[Javadoc and Sources Attachments^]
- https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-maven/#gpg-signed-components[Sign our artifacts^ale] with a GPG key
