<h2 id="what-are-abstract-classes-in-java">What are abstract classes in Java?</h2>

<p>
    In a <a href="/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html" target="_blank">previous post</a> we learned
    what's a Java class. To be more precise, the examples mentioned there are <em>concrete</em> classes. Usually, when
    there's no mention whether a class is concrete or abstract, it's inferred we're talking about a concrete class.
    Likewise, if we want to talk about an abstract one, we usually make the distinction by saying <em>... an abstract
    class...</em>.
</p>
<p>
    So, then, when is a class abstract?
</p>

<h2 id="abstract-class-keyword">The <code>abstract</code> keyword</h2>

<p>
    A class is abstract when the <code>abstract</code> keyword (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-ClassModifier" target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        ClassModifier
    </a>) is used in the class declaration. It is a class that is incomplete, or to be considered incomplete (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.1.1" target="_blank">
        &sect;8.1.1.1
    </a>). Hence, the syntax for the full declaration of an abstract class is the same
    we <a href="/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html#structure" target="_blank">saw already</a>:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
{ClassModifier} class TypeIdentifier [TypeParameters] [ClassExtends] [ClassImplements] [ClassPermits] ClassBody
</code></pre>

<p>Let's see an example</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
abstract class Animal {
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="abstract-classes-abstract-methods">Abstract methods</h2>

<p>
    Ok, the code looks simple. By just adding <code>abstract</code> to our class declaration we made it abstract. But
    what's so especial about it?
</p>
<p>
    Well, when a class is abstract we can declare abstract methods in its
    <a href="/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html#class-body" target="_blank">body</a>. An abstract method
    is a method without a body (no implementation). Then, subclasses that extend the abstract class must provide
    concrete implementations for these abstract methods. For example:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void move();
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="uses-of-abstract-classes">Use cases for abstract classes</h2>

<p>
    Before seeing some elaborated examples, let's understand this: why would we want to declare an abstract class to
    begin with?
</p>
<p>
    Let's recap: we use classes to model our domain, our real world entities and concepts as well as their interactions
    with each other. And, as you might guess, some of those concept and entities are represented in our minds as
    abstract ones.
</p>
<p>
    For example: if we're modeling a software for a Zoo, we need to model animals, the staff, food,
    cages, etc. Some of these concepts need to be modeled at a higher level of abstraction to represent them properly.
    Imagine we want to have a class <code>Tiger</code> to handle information about tigers, <code>Snake</code> to handle
    information about the snakes in the Zoo, <code>Crocodile</code>, <code>Parrot</code>, ... you get the idea.
</p>
<p>
    All of these animals have many things in common; for example, they all move, they eat, they breathe, and so on. But
    they also have many differences: some of them walk, some crawl, some fly, etc.
</p>
<p>
    It's exactly because of their differences that we need to create separate classes for each of them &mdash;that's
    clear&mdash;. But this leaves us with a problem, what do we do with the things (
    <a href="/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html#fields" target="_blank">properties</a>
    and <a href="/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html#methods" target="_blank">behaviors</a>) they share?
    Do we just duplicate those fields and methods in each class? That doesn't sound good. Let's see an example of how
    it would look like:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
class Tiger {
    String name;
    int energy;

    Tiger(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        energy = 100;
    }

    void move() {
        energy -= 3;
        System.out.println(name + " walked");
    }

    void eat() {
        energy++;
        System.out.println(name + " ate");
    }
}

class Snake {
    String name;
    int energy;

    Snake(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        energy = 100;
    }

    void move() {
        energy -= 2;
        System.out.println(name + " crawled");
    }

    void eat() {
        energy++;
        System.out.println(name + " ate");
    }
}

class Parrot {
    String name;
    int energy;

    Parrot(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        energy = 100;
    }

    void move() {
        energy--;
        System.out.println(name + " flew");
    }

    void eat() {
        energy++;
        System.out.println(name + " ate");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    There's a LOT of duplication in that code! Actually, everything, except for the <code>move</code> method is the
    same. This design is difficult to maintain at a bigger scale. Imagine a production code base with hundreds of
    classes and several team members working simultaneously on it. That's not how we should design it for the
    long term.
</p>
<p>
    This is one of the scenarios where abstract classes shine. They allow us to represent abstract concepts and
    "delegate" the specificities to the concrete classes that implement them.
</p>

<h2 id="examples">Example</h2>

<p>
    Let's refactor the previous code to use an abstract class to keep the same fields and methods in it and delegate the
    specifics of each animal to the subclasses.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
abstract class Animal {
    String name;
    int energy;

    Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        energy = 100;
    }

    abstract void move();

    void eat() {
        energy++;
        System.out.println(name + " ate");
    }
}

class Tiger extends Animal {
    Tiger(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    void move() {
        energy -= 3;
        System.out.println(name + " walked");
    }
}

class Snake extends Animal {
    Snake(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    void move() {
        energy -= 2;
        System.out.println(name + " crawled");
    }
}

class Parrot extends Animal {
    Parrot(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    void move() {
        energy--;
        System.out.println(name + " flew");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Now, this is better. Now we can see clearly what fields and methods belong to an <em><code>Animal</code></em>.
    Everything else belongs to the details of specific classes (<code>Tiger</code>, <code>Parrot</code>, etc.)
</p>

<blockquote>
    Notice in the previous code snippet we've used the
    <a href="/articles/2024/java-annotation-interfaces.html#interface-examples" target="_blank">
        <code>@Override</code> annotation
    </a> to make sure we're overriding properly the <code>move</code> method.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="instantiation">Instantiation</h2>

<p>
    Now we can use the abstract class and its subclasses in our code, but, because abstract classes cannot be
    instantiated directly by using the <code>new</code> keyword (see next section), we need to create objects of the
    concrete subclasses and use them polymorphically.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Animal teo = new Tiger("Teo");
    Animal sisi = new Snake("Sisi");
    Animal pepi = new Parrot("Pepi");

    teo.move();
    teo.eat();

    sisi.move();
    sisi.eat();

    pepi.move();
    pepi.eat();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will print in console:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">
Teo walked
Teo ate
Sisi crawled
Sisi ate
Pepi flew
Pepi ate
</code></pre>

<p>
    No matter all the objects (<code>teo</code>, <code>sisi</code>, <code>pepi</code>) are stored in a variable
    (reference) of type <code>Animal</code>, their specific types are different at runtime (such as <code>Tiger</code>)
    and so their behaviors are different (different texts printed in console).
</p>

<h2>Considerations</h2>

<p>
    With abstract classes (and <a href="/articles/2024/java-interfaces.html" target="_blank">interfaces</a>) we can
    simplify complex concepts in the software by modeling these classes based on the real-world concepts we're
    representing. We could talk infinitely about many of the advantages of this design. Some of the most remarkable ones
    are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>It ensures consistent behavior and at the same time it permits various implementations</li>
    <li>Data can now be encapsulated more easily in each class, separately</li>
    <li>Clear separation of boundaries, concerns and responsibilities of each class</li>
    <li>More cohesive data structure, without unnecessary code duplication</li>
    <li>Classes focused on "doing one thing well" &mdash; without bloating their code</li>
    <li>Code base easier to maintain, adapt and scale</li>
</ul>

<p>
    However, they're not a silver bullet, we must use them responsibly and have in mind what's their purpose and the
    problem they solve:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Abstract classes can also have regular (concrete) methods with a complete implementation. These methods can be
        inherited by the subclasses without any need for overriding.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is a compile-time error if an attempt is made to create an instance of an abstract class using a class
        instance creation expression (
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.9.1" target="_blank">
            &sect;15.9.1
        </a>). For example, the following code would report a compilation error:
        <pre><code class="language-java">
            Animal animal = new Animal("Teo"); &lt; -- compilation error!
        </code></pre>
        The closest we can get the previous code is to use an anonymous class &mdash; but this is something completely
        different from what we're discussing here. Let's see it, for the sake of completeness:
        <pre><code class="language-java">
                    Animal animal = new Animal("Tiger") {
                        @Override
                        void move() {
                            energy -=5;
                            System.out.println(name + " moved in an 'anonymous' way");
                        }
                    };
        </code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        We can not declare <code>abstract</code> methods in a non-<code>abstract</code> class (
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.1.1" target="_blank">
            &sect;8.1.1.1
        </a>).
    </li>
    <li>
        Every constructor of a class extending an abstract class must call (directly, or indirectly) the constructor
        of the abstract class. In our previous example this corresponds to the line <code>super(name);</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>abstract</code> methods are inherited. This means if a class inherits some abstract method, that class
        must either: implement the method (override it), or the class itself must be declared <code>abstract</code>
        as well. This case would be useful if we want to represent another level of abstraction. For example, if we'd
        want to model in our software some different types of animal, such as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal" target="_blank"><em>mammals</em></a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile" target="_blank"><em>reptiles</em></a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oviparity" target="_blank"><em>oviparous</em></a>, etc., we could create
        abstract classes for each of them. It would look like this:
        <pre><code class="language-java">
            abstract class Mammal extends Animal {
            }
            // ... other classes follow the same pattern
        </code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Speaking of <em>levels</em> of abstraction; we should avoid creating too many levels of abstractions as then
        our code can become hard to reason about and difficult to maintain in the long term.
    </li>
    <li>
        Abstract classes should be used when the business domain really demands it. We should not use them just
        because they give us a "free" pass to "code re-use". If we don't follow this recommendation we can end up with a
        lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet" target="_blank">accidental complexity</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Similarly, abstract classes should not be used with the purpose of preventing its instantiation. If that's the
        goal, then the correct way of doing it is to declare a constructor for that class and make it
        <code>private</code> (
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.8.10" target="_blank">
            &sect;8.8.10
        </a>).
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="abstract-classes-final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>
    Abstract classes represent a powerful tool at our disposal when following the OOP paradigm. Properly implemented,
    they enhance our code and make it more robust, secure, maintainable and profitable (why not?) in the long term. This
    article is by no means a complete guide to this topic, and there's much more you can review on your own; but
    hopefully this is a good start for you to dive deeper into the documentation and information linked here.
