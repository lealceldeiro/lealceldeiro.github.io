<h2 id="what-are-sealed-classes-in-java">What are sealed classes in Java?</h2>

<p>
    In a <a href="/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html" target="_blank">previous article</a> we learned
    what's a Java class. From a code perspective, sealed classes are not far from a regular class, but they're somehow
    special in the way they can be extended. Let's see it in details.
</p>

<h3 id="sealed-keyword">The <code>sealed</code> keyword</h3>

<p>
    In the aforementioned post there's a reference to a
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-ClassModifier" target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        class modifier
    </a> called <code>sealed</code>. This is the differentiator, from a code perspective, of a sealed class from a
    regular class.
</p>

<p>
    A class is sealed when this keyword is used in its declaration. More formally, it's a class of which all direct
    subclasses are known when it's declared, and no other direct subclasses are desired or required (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.1.2" target="_blank">
        &sect;8.1.1.2
    </a>). So, its declaration is the same we
    <a href="/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html#structure" target="_blank">saw already</a>, with the
    specificity that <code>sealed</code> must be present as a class modifier:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
{ClassModifier} class TypeIdentifier [TypeParameters] [ClassExtends] [ClassImplements] [ClassPermits] ClassBody
</code></pre>

<p>Let's see an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
sealed class PrimaryColor {
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="uses-of-sealed-classes">Use cases for sealed classes</h2>

<p>
    Sealed classes, being a <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/409" target="_blank">relatively new addition</a> to Java,
    have enabled developers to use some features and paradigms more easily. For example, they, together with
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/language/records.html#GUID-6699E26F-4A9B-4393-A08B-1E47D4B2D263"
       target="_blank">
        records
    </a>, and
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/language/pattern-matching-switch-expressions-and-statements.html#GUID-E69EEA63-E204-41B4-AA7F-D58B26A3B232"
       target="_blank">
        pattern matching
    </a>, have made much easier to write our code following a
    <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/data-oriented-programming-java/" target="_blank">
        data-oriented programming
    </a> approach.
</p>
<p>
    I would say this is one of the cases where they fit the best: they allow us to represent in our code the real-world
    data structures more accurately in scenarios where inheritance is needed, but limited to only just some known
    subtypes, and where, therefore, "traditional" inheritance is not a perfect fit.
</p>
<p>
    This means with sealed classes we can create <em>closed type hierarchies</em>,
    <em>limited set of implementations</em>, <em>state machines</em>, <em>limited set of exceptions</em>, and more,
    everything revolving around the main capability of limiting the number of subtypes that can be defined for a given
    class or interface.
</p>
<p>
    This explicit and exhaustive control over the direct subtypes is useful when the class hierarchy is used to model
    the types of values in a domain, rather than as a mechanism for code inheritance and reuse.
</p>

<h2 id="sealed-classes-example">Example</h2>

<p>
    Let's consider the previous class, <code>PrimaryColor</code>; it represents a primary color (concept from our
    real-world business domain). For the sake of simplicity, let's assume red, yellow, and blue are the only possible
    primary colors in our business domain
    <a href="#primaryColorsFootNote" target="_blank" class=" link-underline link-underline-opacity-0"><sup>1</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>
    This naturally leads us to want to have a superclass <code>PrimaryColor</code> and only three subclases:
    <code>Red</code>, <code>Yellow</code>, and <code>Blue</code>. With this setup we have the data structure that
    represents our data, modeled as Java classes/objects. Before sealed classes came along, the code would have looked
    like this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
class PrimaryColor {
}

class Red extends PrimaryColor {
}

class Yellow extends PrimaryColor {
}

class Blue extends PrimaryColor {
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Then other developers could use these classes to interact with our
    <a href="/articles/2024/java-interfaces.html" target="_blank">API</a>. Maybe they need to send a piece of data,
    packed as one of these three classes. Something like this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
PrimaryColor color = new Red();
api.send(color);    // details of the `api` object are omitted here for brevity
</code></pre>
<p>
    That's what we were used to. It represents perfectly our business domain &mdash; well, almost. There's
    one design flaw: we're assuming only <em>red</em>, <em>yellow</em>, and <em>blue</em> could be sent as possible
    values through our <code>api</code> object, but that's not entirely true.
</p>
<p>
    If other developers decide to extend our <code>PrimaryColor</code> class, or any of its subtypes, with a class of
    their own, they could send any other color, for example <code>Pink</code> which is not <em>primary</em>. They could
    even send an object <code>apple</code>, which is not a color, but a fruit!
</p>
<p>
    So, how do we guarantee that only the specific classes we supply as possible values for <em>primary colors</em>
    are used? The answer lies in <em>sealed classes</em>. To be fair, there could be other options such as using the
    <code>instanceof</code> operator, but they're not as clean as using a sealed class, that's why I won't even show
    the code with that alternative.
</p>
<p>
    Back to sealed classes, let's remodel, our code to use this feature:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
sealed class PrimaryColor {
}

final class Red extends PrimaryColor {
}

final class Yellow extends PrimaryColor {
}

final class Blue extends PrimaryColor {
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Notice how <code>PrimaryColor</code> was declared <code>sealed</code> and its subclasses were declared
    <code>final</code>. This is an improvement. <code>Red</code>, <code>Yellow</code>, and <code>Blue</code> cannot be
    further extended; and we're showing intent: anyone reading the code will realize we're trying to limit the possible
    subclasses our <code>PrimaryColor</code> can have.
</p>
<p>
    Sadly, good intentions are not enough. Despite declaring a class as <code>sealed</code> and the subclasses
    <code>final</code>, other classes out of our control could still extend the superclass and be provided as a valid
    <code>PrimaryColor</code> value. For example, this is valid:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
// somewhere, in an external code
final class Pink extends PrimaryColor {
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    To fix this, we need to use another keyword in combination with <code>sealed</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="permits-keyword">The <code>permits</code> keyword</h3>

<p>
    The <em>permits</em> clause specifies all the classes intended as direct subclasses of the class being declared
    (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.6" target="_blank">&sect;8.1.6</a>)
    and
    its structure is as follows:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
permits TypeName {, TypeName}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This means that any other class that is declared to extend our superclass and which is not present in the
    superclass' <em>permit</em> clause will receive a compile-time error.
</p>
<p>Let's revise our previous code to specify the permitted classes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
sealed class PrimaryColor permits Blue, Red, Yellow {
}

final class Red extends PrimaryColor {
}

final class Yellow extends PrimaryColor {
}

final class Blue extends PrimaryColor {
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    By doing this there's no way anyone can extend <code>PrimaryColor</code> further (without us allowing it first in
    the superclass declaration itself).
</p>
<p>
    After this change, the class declaration for <code>Pink</code> would fail and no object of that
    type can be sent where a <code>PrimaryColor</code> is expected.
</p>

<h2 id="sealed-classes-considerations">Considerations</h2>

<p>
    There are some important aspects to keep in mind when working with sealed classes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Interfaces can be declared <code>sealed</code> as well &mdash; as you already might have inferred from previous
        mentions to this.
    </li>
    <li>
        A class/interface cannot be declared <code>sealed</code> without the <em>permits</em> clause and without another
        class/interface implementing/extending it. So, for example, this code alone will report a compile-time error:
        <pre><code class="language-java">
sealed interface Processor {
}
        </code></pre>
        To make it compile we could have a class to implement it &mdash; something like this:
        <pre><code class="language-java">
final class OrderProcessor implements Processor {
}
        </code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        A class is said to be <em>freely extensible</em> if its direct superclass is not <code>sealed</code>,
        and none of its direct superinterfaces are <code>sealed</code>, and it's neither <code>sealed</code>
        nor <code>final</code> itself. Otherwise, such a class is freely extensive if and only if it is declared
        <code>non-sealed</code> (and is not <code>final</code>, of course).
    </li>
    <li>
        Related to the previous point, if a class has a <code>sealed</code> direct superclass or a <code>sealed</code>
        direct superinterface, it's a compilation error if such class is not declared <code>final</code>,
        <code>sealed</code>, or <code>non-sealed</code>, either explicitly or implicitly; that's because when a
        class is declared <code>sealed</code>, it forces all direct subclasses to explicitly declare whether
        they are <code>final</code>, <code>sealed</code>, or <code>non-sealed</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enums are either <em>implicitly</em> <code>final</code> or <em>implicitly</em> <code>sealed</code>, so they can
        implement a sealed interface. Similarly, a record class is <em>implicitly</em> <code>final</code>, so it can
        also implement a sealed interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        A class can not be declared <code>non-sealed</code>, unless it has either a sealed direct superclass or a
        sealed direct superinterface &mdash; otherwise a compilation error is reported.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <em>permits</em> clause cannot be used without the <code>sealed</code> modifier in the type declaration.
    </li>
    <li>
        Every permitted direct subclass specified by the <em>permits</em> clause must be a direct subclass of the
        superclass or a compile-time error occurs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Every type listed in the <em>permits</em> clause must be accessible at compile-time and must be specified only
        once, otherwise the code won't compile.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a sealed class <code>C</code> is associated with a named module (
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.3" target="_blank">
            &sect;7.3
        </a>) , then every class specified in the permits clause of <code>C</code>'s declaration must be associated with
        the same module as <code>C</code>, or a compile-time error is reported
        (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.6"
            target="_blank">&sect;8.1.6</a>).
        This makes perfect sense, as supertypes and subtypes must be <em>resolvable</em>/accessible during compile-time
        and for this to be 100% guaranteed, they must be located in the same module (in modular systems). Also, any
        class hierarchy structure should be declared in the same business domain unit (module), where maintenance is
        provided by the same development team.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Sealed classes without permitted subtypes</h2>

<p>
    Strictly speaking, a class or interface can be declared <code>sealed</code> without declaring the permitted
    subtypes, as long as the above considerations are taken into account. When this happens, the permitted subtypes
    are automatically inferred to those which are direct subtypes.
</p>
<p>
    Care must be taken if this approach is used: sealed classes are usually intended to restrict a type hierarchy. If we
    don't explicitly list the possible subtypes by using the <em>permits</em> clause, then in future other subtypes can
    be added with unintended consequences, such as getting a compile-time error on a <code>switch</code> case because
    it's non-exhaustive anymore.
</p>

<h2 id="sealed-classes-final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>
    Sealed classes are yet another great improvement to the Java language and platform, that gives developers more
    options to build secure robust and predictable software. It specifically allows us to model different kinds
    of a business domain in our code with precision and without resorting to weird workarounds or twisted class
    hierarchies.
</p>
<p>
    Together with other language constructs, sealed classes, enhance our code and make it more succinct, readable,
    and maintainable, which leads towards more productive teams. If this articles doesn't cover everything about sealed
    classes, it is a good start for you to read and investigate more about this topic so you can put it in practice
    in your day-to-day job.
