The `static` keyword in Java ...

== What's the `static` keyword in Java?

[quote,Oxford English Dictionary]
____
*static*

[Computing] (of a process or variable) not able to be changed during a set period,
for example, while a program is running.
____

That's how the Oxford English Dictionary defines _static_ as a word in the field of computing.
_Not able to change;_ that's the most important part.

Ok, we didn't have to check the dictionary to know that: when something is static, it doesn't change.
For example, a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse[lighthouse^] is static in the sense that it doesn't move
from one place to another, like an animal can do.
Although the lantern(s) and related components move, the tower structure _doesn't change its position_ on the soil.

How much does this meaning relate to the `static` keyword in Java?

Very much!

The `static` keyword in Java can be used to modify the definition of
link:/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html#what-are-java-classes[classes^],
link:/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html#fields[fields^],
link:/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html#methods[methods^],
initializers and more.
It's always used to reflect a sense of _not changing its [the component's] behavior_ depending on other factors,
such as an object state.

Let's see some use cases along with some meaningful examples.

== Use cases for the `static` keyword

=== Static classes and interfaces

As we link:/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html#nested-classes[saw previously^],
we can declare inner classes and interfaces, that's it, classes and interfaces as members of
other classes and interfaces.
For example:

[source,java]
----
class A {
    class B {
    }
}
----

In the previous code, `B` is an inner class.
It's a member of `A` (see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/nested.html[tutorial^] for a full example).
This is a code smell, because to create an instance of `B`, we must create first an instance of `A`:

[source,java]
----
var a = new A();
var b = a.new B();
----

or the shorter version:

[source,java]
----
var b = new A().new B();
----

That code is almost never correct or justified. Just to mention some of its many flaws, we can say:

- To create an instance of `B`, we must allocate first memory to create an instance of `A`.
- If a declaration of some type (i.e.: a member variable) in a particular scope (i.e.: the inner class)
has the same name as another declaration in the enclosing scope,
then the declaration shadows the declaration of the enclosing scope.

In such cases, the correct approach is to declare a static nested class
(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.1.4[&sect;8.1.1.4^]),
or a
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.1.1.3[static nested interface^],
as it fits our needs:

[source,java]
----
class A {
    static class B {
    }
}
----

Now `B` no longer "lives within" `A`, and we can simply use it like this:

[source,java]
----
var b = new A.B();
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Notice we can't use `static` as a class or interface modifier
if the class or interface is not a member of another class or interface.

For example, in the previous code snippet, we can't declare the class `A` as `static` or it causes a compilation error.
