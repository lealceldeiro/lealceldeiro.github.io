Kanban is a tool that aims to improve efficiency by reducing waste of time and doing things more efficiently.
In this article, you'll see a quick introduction to this tool, what it is, how to use it,
and whether it can be applied (and how) to our work process.
The views and knowledge expressed here are those from
 the perspective of a Software Engineer focused on backend development—not an expert in agile methodologies.

== Getting started

No matter what business we're in, we're always finding ways to make things more efficiently.
Lean methodologies were introduced with the purpose of making our business processes more efficiently.
They were born in manufacturing environments but can be applied to almost any kind of business activity or process.

They can be seen as a set of tools that can be adapted or modified to any environment,
according to the problem being solved.

One of these tools is *Kanban*.

== What is Kanban?

In every business, there's always a desired result that's preceded by a series of steps or tasks.
These steps or tasks almost always carry some form of result, let it be a document, a piece of information,
or any other output that is also used as the input for another step or task.

Not having these results (and on time) can cause delays for the final customer and, consequently, lost in our business.
On the flip side, having too many results (documents, deliverables, etc.) can become cumbersome to manage and can
also have the same undesired effects.

This is where Kanban comes in: it helps us in learning and managing an optimal flow of work within the process.

Some basic rules to implement Kanban are:

. Visualize the workflow: A visual representation of the workflow lets us see how tasks move from being "not done" to
"done right".
. Limit work in process/progress (WIP):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGJpez7rvc0[Get more done by doing less^] (at the same time). There's a limit in the
tasks we can do at the same time, going beyond that limit will only decrease our productivity. This is the same
principle we apply in programming: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm[divide and conquer^]:
we should decompose "bigger" tasks into smaller ones, and do them one at the time to get them done correctly.
Kanban metrics allow us to find that "optimal" number.
. Measure and improve the flow: Improvements should always be a result of decisions made in an informed way. Kanban
is no different. In order for us to improve those areas where we're not being as productive as possible, we need to
first measure the steps, tasks. How much is this task taking and why? How much did we take to release feature XYZ?
How many hours did we spend in the analysis of feature ABC? Finding a good tool that allows us to measure our
tasks/steps properly is very important to enhance our processes. Some examples are
https://kanbantool.com/[Kanbantool^] and https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/features/kanban-boards[Jira^].

One good thing about Kanban is that we don't have to change what we may already be doing in our business.
We simply adapt the Kanban tool to our processes, to start measuring, adjusting and optimizing our tasks for
maximum efficiency.

Put in another way: we use Kanban in our existing business to identify ways to improve our already existing processes;
we don't need to change our processes at once and "implement Kanban"—we don't lose the good things we're doing already.

== Using Kanban

=== Can we apply it?
Whenever we consider using some new tool, framework, process, etc. we immediately think: can we apply this?,
will it work for me?

It's no different with Kanban. Can we apply it in the software development processes?

Yes.
Many would agree with me.
Many others would say "yes, but some Scrum-like" methodology would fit better for my use case—and
that may be completely right as well.
As always, the answer is "it depends".

Software development teams use Kanban to organize their work.
That is, (roughly speaking,) defining a backlog of tasks,
prioritizing them, doing some analysis work,
"moving" them to "development", "review", "done", and the list goes on and on, as long as the teams see it fit.

That's the interesting thing about it: it's not a restrictive framework that dictates "what must be done", instead it
offers guides on how things could improve, rather than specific actions, so it can be easily adopted
by different businesses.

=== How could it help us?

Kanban should not be "enforced".
As with any other tool, we must be able to identify pai points we have in our teams
(or solo-team) and check if the tool can really help us.

For example, if we feel we're always busy, and yet we can't get anything done/completed.
Or, if we feel the process, as a whole, is not as efficient as it could be.
Or maybe we simply don't have an answer to common questions like "where are we at now?",
"when will task XYZ be completed?", "who's working on feature ABC?", or "what should I work on now?".

In such cases, it may be worth taking some time and consider something like Kanban; something that could lead
to improve our efficiency and remove waste of time and resources.

=== What changes are required to use Kanban

Good news!
There's no need to overhaul the whole business practices in order for us to adopt Kanban.
It provides the means to visualize what we're already doing and which parts could be tweaked to be more efficient.
On top of that, the changes required to make things better
can be implemented gradually—no need to throw everything away and start from scratch!

== How to get started with it

That's the most challenging part of almost anything: getting started.
Once we get that little first step, things start to turn smoother.

So it's important to know how to take that first step.

One approach is to make something like a map or visual representation of our current workflow.
This means identifying major processes in our organization/business, department, area, etc.
It's here where we also identify (mentioned in no particular order):

- which are the steps/tasks we currently have in our process?
- where are they coming from?
- how are they defined, assigned and prioritized?

With answers to questions like this, we create one column for the Kanban board.
So, for a software development team, we could have the following columns:

- Backlog
- Analysis
- Design
- Review
- Development
- Code Review
- Testing
- Release
- Support

It's after we do this step that we can identify improvements in our current workflow, so it's normal if some of the
things we're doing are not as efficient as we'd like them to be.
That's expected: it's from this point from where we start to see areas of improvements and form where we can start to
enhance our flow; so it's important to not try to "beatify" the current state of our processes:
we need to see our flaws, so we can tackle them.

== Other considerations

=== Can we use practices from other agile methodologies, like Scrum?

Yes.
