The access control mechanisms in Java allow us to have a more secure way of building our applications, libraries,
and code in general.
In this article, you'll learn what are the access controls implemented by the Java platform,
how to use them and have a better picture of how they work in general.

== What's "access control" in Java?

Access control refers to the mechanisms defined by Java
to guarantee that packages, classes, etc. are accessible only to those entities
which have the correct permissions
and not to others which are not entitled to access them.

This sometimes can be seen as a restrictive behavior, but it's more than that:
it shields users of a class or package from depending on specific implementation details that are irrelevant to them
and that could potentially break their code if such details are changed.

In short, if access to an entity is permitted, that entity is said to be _accessible_.

== How's accessibility to an entity determined?

=== Top level classes

==== `public`

If a top level class or interface is declared `public`,
then it may be accessed by any code declared within the same module.

On top of that, if such a class or interface is a member of a package that is exported by its module,
then it'll also be accessible by code located in another module to which the package is exported,
as long as the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.3[compilation unit^]
in which the class or interfaces is declared is visible to that other module
(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-6.html#jls-6.6.1[ยง6.6.1^]).

In contrast, if the class or interface is part of a module that's not exported, it'll be accessible only by code
located in the same module.

==== package access

When a top level class or interface is declared as "package private" it'll be accessible only from code located within
the same package.

NOTE: _package access_ is the implicit (default) access given when no modifier (`public` or `private`) is specified.

=== Members

=== Array types
