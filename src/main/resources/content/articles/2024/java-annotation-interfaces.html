<h2 id="what-s-a-java-interface">What's a Java annotation interface?</h2>

<p>
    In a <a href="java-interfaces.html" target="_blank">previous article</a> we learned about normal
    interfaces. This begs the question, then, what's a Java annotation interface?
</p>
<p>
    An <em>annotation interface</em> (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.6" target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        &sect;9.6
    </a>) is an interface declared with a distinct syntax, intended to be implemented by reflective representations
    of <em>annotations</em> (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.7" target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        &sect;9.7
    </a>).
</p>

<p>
    We can say that it's a specialized kind of interface and to differentiate it from a normal interface, the keyword
    <code>interface</code> is preceded by an at sign (<code>@</code>). For example:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
@interface TraceableMethod {
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Once we have declared (or imported) an annotation interface in our code, we can use it to augment
    our application, for example, to enhance the Java type system with nullability information. An example of this
    is Spring's
    <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/lang/NonNull.html"
       target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        <code>@NonNull</code>
    </a> annotation.
</p>

<p>
    In this sense, annotations can be used as well with static code analysis tools to detect possible bugs in our
    code in an early stage and increase productivity in general by avoiding common mistakes in our code and focus in
    our business logic.
</p>

<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>

<p>
    From the previous example you're probably already inferring the syntax of this type of interfaces. Let's see it:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
{InterfaceModifier} @ interface TypeIdentifier AnnotationInterfaceBody
</code></pre>
<p>Where</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-InterfaceModifier" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>{InterfaceModifier}</code>
        </a> is one of:
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-Annotation" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>Annotation</code>
        </a>, <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>abstract</code>,
        <code>static</code>, <code>sealed</code>, <code>non-sealed</code>, <code>strictfp</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>@</code> is the special sing used to indicate that this is an annotation interface declaration, and not
        a normal interface declaration.
    </li>
    <li><code>interface</code> is the Java keyword used to specify we're declaring an interface.</li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-3.html#jls-TypeIdentifier" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>TypeIdentifier</code>
        </a> is the name we want to give the annotation. In our previous example we used <code>TraceableMethod</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-AnnotationInterfaceBody"
           target="_blank" class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>AnnotationInterfaceBody</code>
        </a>
        is the <code>body</code> of our annotation, including the curly braces (<code>{}</code>). See next section.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="syntax-body">Body</h3>

<p>
    The structure of the body of an annotation interface (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-AnnotationInterfaceMemberDeclaration"
       target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        AnnotationInterfaceMemberDeclaration
    </a>) is as follows:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
{
    AnnotationInterfaceElementDeclaration
    ConstantDeclaration
    ClassDeclaration
    InterfaceDeclaration
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Let's analyze
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-AnnotationInterfaceElementDeclaration"
       target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        AnnotationInterfaceElementDeclaration
    </a>. The rest of the elements follow the same <sup>1</sup> rules as those described in
    <a href="java-interfaces.html#interface-body" target="_blank">normal interface declarations</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="elements">Annotation interface elements</h4>

<p>
    Annotations (like classes and interfaces) can have attributes. The difference is that they look like methods
    in the annotation body, even though they're used as normal attributes where the annotation is used. Let's see an
    example to get a better idea.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
@interface TraceableMethod {
    public String traceName() default "TracedMethod";
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Here, we've defined an attribute (the method-like syntax) in the annotation declaration called
    <code>traceName</code>. Notice how the syntax is somehow the same but different from fields declared in normal
    interfaces and classes. For example, the modifier (<code>public</code>), the type (<code>String</code>), and the
    identifier (<code>traceName</code>) are specified similar to how they'd be specified in a class or interface, but
    then we have the parenthesis (<code>()</code>) and the <code>default</code> keyword used after it, along the actual
    attribute default value (<code>"TracedMethod"</code>).
</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-the-annotation">How to use annotations?</h2>

<p>
    Once the annotation is created (through the annotation interface declaration) it can be placed on classes, methods,
    fields, and a few other places, and it must appear immediately before what's being annotated. For example, let's
    suppose we have the following class.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
class Processor {
    void process() {
    }

    String getName() {
        return "processor";
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    Now, let's suppose that the goal of the annotation we just declared (<code>TraceableMethod</code>) is, given a
    class, to "mark" the methods in that class whose names we want to print when our program starts up. For this to
    happen we must do two things: first, <em>annotate</em> the methods, and second, when our program starts up, "scan"
    our code and find these methods <em>annotated</em> as <code>TraceableMethod</code>. Let's see it.
</p>

<h3 id="annotating-an-element">Annotate the methods</h3>

<p>For now, we're going to annotate only the <code>process</code> method.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">
class Processor {
    @TraceableMethod
    void process() {
    }

    String getName() {
        return "processor";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="find-elements-annotate-in-our-code">Find the methods annotated in our code</h3>

<pre><code class="language-java">
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Class<?> clazz = Processor.class;
    Method[] methods = clazz.getDeclaredMethods();

    for (Method method : methods) {
        for (Annotation annotation : method.getAnnotations()) {
            if (annotation instanceof TraceableMethod traceableMethodAnnotation) {
                System.out.printf("""
                                  Method %s annotated as %s - trace name: %s
                                  """,
                                  method.getName(),
                                  TraceableMethod.class.getSimpleName(),
                                  traceableMethodAnnotation.traceName());
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    If you run this example you'll see an empty output. That's because we did not specify the
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/annotation/RetentionPolicy.html"
       target="_blank">
        retention policy
    </a> of the annotation.
</p>
<p>There are three values we can use here:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/annotation/RetentionPolicy.html#CLASS"
           target="_blank" class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>CLASS</code>
        </a> (keep the annotation after the code is compiled but ignored by the JVM during runtime)
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/annotation/RetentionPolicy.html#RUNTIME"
           target="_blank" class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>RUNTIME</code>
        </a> (keep the annotation after the code is compiled and by the JVM during runtime)
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/annotation/RetentionPolicy.html#SOURCE"
           target="_blank" class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>SOURCE</code>
        </a> (discard the annotation by the compiler)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    So, because <code>CLASS</code> is the default retention policy our annotation was kept after compilation, but
    during runtime, it was not taken into account by the JVM, hence the call to <code>method.getAnnotations()</code>
    returned an empty array. How do we fix it? We change the retention policy... by using a meta-annotation!
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@interface TraceableMethod {
    public String traceName() default "TracedMethod";
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    Now, if you run the same code again you'll se the following output:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">
Method process annotated as TraceableMethod - trace name: TracedMethod
</code></pre>

<h3 id="specifying-attributes">Specifying annotation attributes</h3>

<p>
    What about the field <code>traceName</code> declared in the body of the annotation? From the previous output
    we can see it took the default value (<code>TracedMethod</code>); but what if we want to change it. Simple, we can
    specify it within parenthesis (<code>()</code>) after the annotation name.
</p>
<p>
    Let's annotate the method <code>getName</code>, in <code>Processor</code>, and let's specify for it a different
    <code>traceName</code> value.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
class Processor {
    @TraceableMethod
    void process() {
    }

    @TraceableMethod(traceName = "String returning method")
    String getName() {
        return "processor";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    When we run again the code, now this is the output:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">
Method getName annotated as TraceableMethod - trace name: String returning method
Method process annotated as TraceableMethod - trace name: TracedMethod
</code></pre>
<p>
    As you see here, now the method <code>getName</code> is reported with a <code>traceName</code> value different from
    the default one, that's it, <code>String returning method</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="interface-examples">Example: Using the <code>@Override</code> annotation</h2>

<p>
    The previous example is contrived and somehow silly, the code doesn't do anything useful. It was for demonstration
    purposes. Let's see an example of an annotation that's used very often and which is extremely helpful:
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Override.html" target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        @Override
    </a>.
</p>
<p>
    This annotation provides us with great benefit during compile-time by "forcing" us to properly implement an
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)" target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        equals
    </a> method in our class.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the common error made when overriding, shown in the next code snippet:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
class Processor {
    public boolean equals(Processor obj) {
        // return true or false ... omitted for brevity
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    In this code there's one subtle mistake: the argument received in the <code>equals</code> method is of type
    <code>Processor</code>, but it should be of type <code>Object</code> as per the specs. However, we may not notice
    it. And the compiler can't help us: it's a completely valid java code; in fact this code creates an accidental
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html" target="_blank">
        overload
    </a>.
</p>
<p>
    <code>@Override</code> to the rescue! If we annotate the method with <code>@Override</code>, now the compiler knows
    we're intending to override the <code>Object</code>'s <code>equals</code> method and reports an error at
    compile time (Something like <em>"Method does not override method from its superclass"</em>).
</p>
<p>
    This would be the fixed version of the previous code:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    // code omitted for brevity
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    It's worth mentioning that we're not limited to the <code>equals</code> method. We can use this annotation with
    any method we intend to override from some of the class ancestors.
</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-interfaces">Do we need annotation interfaces?</h2>

<p>
    Technically speaking, we may not strictly need them to write our day to day software, but it's really difficult
    for me to imagine any modern Java program that doesn't use some form of annotation. They enhance our code in ways
    that makes our lives (as developers) much easier than if we had to do the same work programmatically.
</p>
<p>
    Annotations are also used to provide metadata at runtime. For example, the Jakarta Persistence API (
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Persistence" target="_blank">
        JPA
    </a>) uses several annotations from the package <code>jakarta.persistence</code> to work internally and provide
    all the features it provides. So, it's not only small enhancements we get in our code; we're talking at this point
    of entire frameworks relying on annotations to function properly. This is something I don't see going away any time
    soon.
</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>
    There's a bunch of articles, official documentation, and books out there that we can read to get more knowledge
    about annotations. Hopefully, this is a good start for you to increase your knowledge a bit more about the Java
    platform and sparkle your interest in reading more about interface annotations and other use cases and details
    not covered in this article.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
    <sup>1</sup>: While the structure and most of the "rules" are the same, there are actually some subtle differences.
    For example, the return type of a method declared in the body of annotation interface must be one of: a primitive
    type, <code>String</code>, <code>Class</code> or an invocation of <code>Class</code>, an enum class type, an
    annotation interface type, or an array type whose component type is one of the previously mentioned types. If such
    return type is different, a compile-time error occurs.
</p>
