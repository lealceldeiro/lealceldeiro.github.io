<h2 id="what-s-a-java-interface">What's a Java interface?</h2>

<p>
    If you ask someone who's not a programmer, or software engineer, or the like, "what's an interface?", most probably
    you'll get answers around "it's a boundary where two entities interact", "it's some sort of connection between two
    things through which they interact with each other", or "it's the means through which two unrelated elements
    interact with each other".
</p>
<p>Then, what's a Java interface?</p>
<p>
    Interfaces in Java define behaviors. These behaviors are expressed as a
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html" target="_blank">group of methods</a>
    in the body of the interface.
</p>
<p>
    Then, some
    <a href="https://lealceldeiro.github.io/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html" target="_blank">class</a>
    can implement the interface methods as it sees fit, that's it, it defines how the behaviors specified in the
    interface are actually implemented. This class would be the first "entity" from our previous wider definition of
    interface.
</p>
<p>
    The second "entity", the one that would interact with the class implementation through the interface,
    would be the caller: the one that <em>calls</em> the methods.
</p>
<p>
    In summary we could say: the interface defines what behaviors/methods it provides to callers, and
    that must be implemented by any concrete class. It establishes a well-defined
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" target="_blank">API</a> contract between two parties: one party that
    provides the implementation and another party that will consume it.
</p>
<p>
    If we were to create a simulation of a restaurant to illustrate the usage of an interface. We could have three
    elements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A customer</li>
    <li>A waiter</li>
    <li>The interface, through which the customer asks the waiter to bring some food</li>
</ul>
<p>
    We could call these three elements like this, respectively:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>Customer</code> (class)</li>
    <li><code>Waiter</code> (another class)</li>
    <li><code>OrderProcessor</code> (the interface)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="interface-declaration-in-java">How does an interface declaration look like in Java?</h2>

<p>Let's look at an example, by following our previous analogy of the restaurant:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
// interface declaration
interface OrderProcessor {
    // here we declare only the method (behavior) - but not the actual implementation
    public void bringFood(String dishName);
}

// a class that implements the interface
class Waiter implements OrderProcessor {
    // the actual logic of the method (body of the method) is defined here
  	public void bringFood(String dishName) {
	    System.out.println("Brought " + dishName + " to customer");
    }
}

// another class that can ask for food
class Customer {
    private String favoriteDish = "Fish and Vegetables";

    void askForFood(OrderProcessor orderProcessor) {
	    // the customer interacts with the interface OrderProcessor
        orderProcessor.bringFood(favoriteDish);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This interface is called <code>OrderProcessor</code> and it defines the "bring food" behavior, which is declared as
    a method named: <code>bringFood</code>.
</p>
<p>This is a very simple example; let's dive deeper into the intricacies of interfaces in Java.</p>

<h3 id="declaring-an-interface">Declaring an interface</h3>

<p>There are two types of interface declarations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Normal interface declarations</em></li>
    <li><em>Annotation interface declarations</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
    In this article only the normal interface declaration is covered. Annotation interface declaration will be covered
    in a separate article.
</p>
<p>Let's see the structure of an interface declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">

            <code>[InterfaceExtends]</code>
        </a> is the portion of the interface declaration where we can specify, after the keyword <code>extends</code>,

</ul>

<p>
    It's important to note that unlike a class, an interface cannot be declared <code>final</code>. However, an
    interface may be declared <code>sealed</code> (

        &sect;9.1.1.4
    </a>) to limit its subclasses and subinterfaces.
</p>

<h4 id="interface-body">Interface body</h4>

<p>
    The structure of an interface body (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-InterfaceMemberDeclaration"
       target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        <code>{InterfaceMemberDeclaration}</code>
    </a>) is as follows:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
{
    ConstantDeclaration
	InterfaceMethodDeclaration
	ClassDeclaration
	InterfaceDeclaration
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's see what each of these elements are, and some examples of how they're used.</p>

<h5 id="interface-constants">Constants</h5>

<p>
    Constants (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-ConstantDeclaration" target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        <code>ConstantDeclaration</code>
    </a>) can be referred to as interface attributes, properties, fields. They are similar to class fields, except they
    can NOT be modified &mdash;they're final&mdash;, and their declaration is as follows:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
{ConstantModifier} UnannType VariableDeclaratorList;
</code></pre>

<p>In this case</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-ConstantModifier" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>ConstantModifier</code>
        </a> can be any of the previously mentioned <code>Annotation</code>, <code>public</code>, <code>static</code>,
        and/or <code>final</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-UnannType" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>UnannType</code>
        </a>, in short, refers to all the types we can use to declare what type the field is. For example,
        <code>Integer</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-VariableDeclaratorList"

           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>VariableDeclaratorList</code>
        </a>, simply put, is the actual name of the field (variable) and, optionally, and initializer.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Let's see an example of a constant in our <code>OrderProcessor</code> interface.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
interface OrderProcessor {
    public int MAX_ORDERS_NUMBER = 1000;
    // ... rest of the code omitted for brevity
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Here, we declared a constant <code>MAX_ORDERS_NUMBER</code> of type <code>int</code> with a value of
    <code>1000</code>. It is <code>public</code> (default in interfaces), so it's publicly accessible by anyone with
    access to the interface.
</p>

<h5 id="interface-method-declarations">Method declarations</h5>
<p>
    Method declarations (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-InterfaceMethodDeclaration"
       target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        <code>InterfaceMethodDeclaration</code>
    </a>) are the declarations of the methods defined in the interface. They
    are the methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface, unless the interface itself
    provides a default implementation.
</p>
<p>
    Default method implementations is a feature added in
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/enhancements.html#javase8" target="_blank">
        Java 8
    </a> that allows us to define the method body (its actual implementation) in the interface itself, as opposite to
    abstract methods, which require a concrete class to implement them.
</p>
<p>
    More formally, a <em>default method</em> is an instance method declared in an interface with the
    <code>default</code> modifier. Its body is always represented by a block, which provides a default implementation
    for any class that implements the interface without overriding the method. These methods are distinct from concrete
    methods, which are declared in classes, and from <code>private</code> interface methods, which are neither
    inherited nor overridden (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.4" target="_blank">
        &sect;9.4
    </a>).
</p>
<p>
    Let's see now how to declare these methods in our <code>OrderProcessor</code> interface.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
interface OrderProcessor {
    public int MAX_ORDERS_NUMBER = 1000;

    // abstract method -- must be implemented by the concrete class
    public void bringFood(String dishName);

    // also, an abstract method -- must be implemented by the concrete class
    public abstract void bringWater();

    // any class implementing the interface will inherit this
    // default method implementation, unless overridden
    default String getType() {
        return "Waiter";
    }

    // only available to be called within the interface itself
    private int getMaxOrders() {
        return MAX_ORDERS_NUMBER;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h5 id="interface-nested-class-declaration">Class declaration</h5>
<p>
    Nested (or inner) class declarations (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-ClassDeclaration" target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        <code>ClassDeclaration</code>
    </a>) were covered in a previous post (
    <a href="https://lealceldeiro.github.io/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html#nested-classes"
       target="_blank">
        Java classes and objects
    </a>). Let's quickly review an example of how it would look like in the body of an interface:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
interface OrderProcessor {
    // inner class declaration
    class BillCalculator {
    }
    // ... rest of the code omitted for brevity
}
</code></pre>

<h5 id="interface-inner-interface-declaration">Interface Declaration</h5>
<p>
    Nested (or inner) interface declarations (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-InterfaceDeclaration" target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        <code>InterfaceDeclaration</code>
    </a>) were also covered in
    <a href="https://lealceldeiro.github.io/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html#nested-interfaces"
       target="_blank">
        that post
    </a>. Let's see how to use it in our example.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
interface OrderProcessor {
    interface Calculator {
    }
    // ... rest of the code omitted for brevity
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="implementing-an-interface">Implementing an interface</h3>
<p>
    An interface is not of much use without a concrete class that implements its methods. So, let's get into how a class
    can implement the methods defined in the body of an interface.
</p>
<p>
    A class can be declared to <em>directly implement</em> one or more interfaces (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html" target="_blank">&sect;9</a>,
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.5" target="_blank">
        &sect;8.1.5
    </a>). This means that any instance of that class implements all the <code>abstract</code> methods specified by
    the interface.
</p>
<p>
    A class necessarily implements all the interfaces that its direct superclasses and direct superinterfaces do. This
    multiple interface inheritance allows objects to support multiple common behaviors without sharing a superclass
    (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html" target="_blank">&sect;9</a>).
</p>
<p>Let's review again our previous example.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
interface OrderProcessor {
    public void bringFood(String dishName);
}

class Waiter implements OrderProcessor {
  	public void bringFood(String dishName) {
        System.out.println("Brought " + dishName + " to customer");
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    Here, we specify after the keyword <code>implements</code> all the interfaces that the class implements. Notice that
    it's mandatory for the <code>Waiter</code> class to implement the method <code>bringFood</code>, otherwise the
    code won't compile.
</p>
<p>
    Let's see how the <code>Waiter</code> class can implement another interface: <code>Serializable</code>, which
    belongs to the <code>java.io</code> package.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
class Waiter implements OrderProcessor, Serializable {
  	public void bringFood(String dishName) {
	      System.out.println("Brought " + dishName + " to customer");
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    As you notice, we only need to add the new interface being implemented after a comma (<code>,</code>). This way we
    can implement all the interfaces we want.
</p>

<h3 id="extending-an-interface">Extending an interface</h3>

<p>
    Sometimes there are interfaces that do not provide all the method declarations we need. In such cases, sometimes we
    need to create an interface that "inherits" that other interface method declarations, and, on top of that, add our
    own. This way any class implementing the new interface will inherit all the methods. This is a
    <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/introduction-spring-data-jpa-inheritance-rest-app" target="_blank">
        common pattern used
    </a> when implementing our own
    <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa/" target="_blank">Spring Data JPA</a> Repositories.
</p>
<p>
    An interface may be declared to be a <em>direct extension</em> of one or more other interfaces, meaning that it
    inherits all the member classes and interfaces, instance methods, and <code>static</code> fields of the interfaces
    it extends, except for any members that it may override or hide (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html" target="_blank">&sect;9</a>).
</p>
<p>Let's see in our example how would such extension look like.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">
interface Processor&lt;T&gt; {                              // 1
	public void process(T element);                   // 2
}

interface OrderProcessor extends Processor&lt;String&gt; {  // 3
    public void bringFood(String dishName);

	public default void process(String dishName) {    // 4
	    bringFood(dishName);
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    There are several things going on in this example, so let's review it, point by point from the previous commented
    lines:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <code>Processor</code> is declared as a generic interface that accepts a type <code>T</code>
        (this is the type of the elements the interface will work with). See
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.1.2" target="_blank">
            &sect;9.1.2
        </a> for more information about this.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>Processor</code> declares an abstract method called <code>process</code>, which takes an argument of type
        <code>T</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>OrderProcessor</code> extends <code>Processor</code> and it specifies that the
        elements it will work with are of type <code>String</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>OrderProcessor</code> provides a default implementation for the <code>process</code> method, inherited
        from <code>Processor</code>. The default implementation is actually just a call to the abstract method
        <code>bringFood</code> and it will be inherited by any concrete class.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>This example shows how powerful our implementations can be by combining different Java features.</p>

<h3 id="evolving-interfaces">Evolving interfaces</h3>

<p>
    When an interface is defined and made available to client code (let it be our own code, library users, or third
    party vendors who rely on our interfaces definitions), it's extremely important to be careful with how we evolve it
    so we don't break existing code that use the current API contract defined by the interface.
</p>
<p>
    While this is a topic for another whole article. There are some important points we should touch upon here. The
    following points are an extract from
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-13.html#jls-13.5" target="_blank">
        &sect;13.5
    </a>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If an interface that is declared <code>public</code> is changed to not be declared <code>public</code>, then
        an <code>IllegalAccessError</code> is thrown if a pre-existing binary is linked that needs but no longer has
        access to the interface type, so such a change is not recommended for widely distributed interfaces.
    </li>
    <li>
        If an interface that was freely extensible (
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.1.1.4" target="_blank">
            &sect;9.1.1.4
        </a>) is changed to be declared <code>sealed</code>, then an <code>IncompatibleClassChangeError</code> is thrown
        if a binary of a pre-existing subclass or subinterface of this interface is loaded and is not a permitted direct
        subclass or subinterface of this interface (
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.1.4" target="_blank">
            &sect;9.1.4
        </a>); such a change is also not recommended for widely distributed classes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Adding an interface to the set of permitted direct subinterfaces of a <code>sealed</code> interface will not
        break compatibility with pre-existing binaries. However, it may cause the execution of an exhaustive
        <code>switch</code> (
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.11.1" target="_blank">
            &sect;14.11.1
        </a>) to
        fail with an error (a <code>MatchException</code> may be thrown) if the <code>switch</code> encounters
        an instance of the new permitted direct subinterface that was not known at compile time (
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.11.3" target="_blank">&sect;14.11.3</a>,

    </li>
    <li>
        If a class or interface is removed from the set of permitted direct subclasses or subinterfaces of a
        <code>sealed</code> interface, then an <code>IncompatibleClassChangeError</code> is thrown if the pre-existing
        binary of the removed class or interface is loaded.

        Changing an interface that was declared <code>sealed</code> to be declared <code>non-sealed</code> does not
        break compatibility with pre-existing binaries. However, a <code>non-sealed</code> interface <em>X</em> must
        have a <code>sealed</code> direct superinterface. Deleting the <code>non-sealed</code> modifier would prevent
        <em>X</em> from being recompiled, as every interface with a <code>sealed</code> direct superinterface must
        be <code>sealed</code> or <code>non-sealed</code>.

    <li>Deleting a member from an interface may cause linkage errors in pre-existing binaries.</li>

<p>Let's see some more examples.</p>

<h4 id="example1">A public generic interface with two constants, one private method and one public method</h4>

<pre><code class="language-java">
public interface Processor&lt;T&gt; {
    int MAX_PROCESSES = 5;

    private boolean isValid(T e) {
        return e != null;
    }
}

<h4 id="example2">
    A public interface with one static inner class and one static inner interface; both of them have
    package-private visibility
</h4>
<pre><code class="language-java">
public interface OrderProcessor {
    class Sender {                  // &lt;-- the 'static' keyword is default here before the keyword 'class'

<h3 id="why-do-we-need-interfaces">Why do we need interfaces?</h3>

<p>
    While interfaces are not a mandatory component of the software we implement, it's true our programs can use
    interfaces to provide a common supertype for otherwise unrelated classes, and to make it unnecessary for related
    classes to share a common <code>abstract</code> superclass (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html" target="_blank">&sect;9</a>).
</p>
<p>
    Many software patterns have been put into practice taking into account the concept of interfaces. These patterns
    solve well-known problems with a defined context and solution. Just to mention a few, we could point out
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">SOLID</a>, and many of the patterns presented by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" target="_blank">GoF</a>; thus they bring flexibility,
    robustness, re-usability and a lot more benefits to our well-designed software solutions.
</p>
<p>
    Nowadays, when systems are more complex, and we need to model more complex scenarios as well, interfaces
    play a vital role in promoting a loose coupling between the elements of our software. They're also a very powerful
    element of Java: they allow a class to inherit behaviors from multiple supertypes (so we can overcome the
    "limitation" of not having
    <a href="https://medium.com/edureka/multiple-inheritance-in-java-a996c26143ac" target="_blank">
        multiple inheritance in Java
    </a>), they play a pivotal role in
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/polymorphism.html" target="_blank">
        polymorphism
    </a>, they allow us to define clear boundaries and responsibilities for each software component and in most cases
    they make easier for us to implement automated test for the code we write.

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>
    There is so much material we could revise about Java interfaces that this single article wouldn't be enough to cover
    it all. I've presented here high level information as well as several of the implementation details about this topic
    which I hope, along with the linked documentation, is a good start for you to review and deepen your knowledge about
    Java.
