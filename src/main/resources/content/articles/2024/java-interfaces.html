<h2 id="what-s-a-java-interface">What's a Java interface?</h2>

<p>
    If you ask someone who's not a programmer, or software engineer, or the like, "what's an interface?", most probably
    you'll get answers around "it's a boundary where two entities interact", "it's some sort of connection between two
    things through which they interact with each other", or "it's the means through which two unrelated elements
    interact with each other".
</p>
<p>Then, what's a Java interface?</p>
<p>
    Interfaces in Java define behaviors. These behaviors are expressed as a
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html" target="_blank">group of methods</a>
    in the body of the interface.
</p>
<p>
    Then, some
    <a href="https://lealceldeiro.github.io/articles/2024/java-oop-classes-and-objects.html" target="_blank">class</a>
    can implement the interface methods as it sees fit, that's it, it defines how the behavior specified in the
    interface is actually implemented. This class would be the first "entity" from our previous wider definition of
    interface.
</p>
<p>
    The second "entity", the one that would interact with the class implementation through the interface,
    would be the caller: the one that <em>calls</em> the method.
</p>
<p>
    If we were to create a simulation of a restaurant to illustrate the usage of an interface. We could have three
    elements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>A customer</li>
    <li>A waiter</li>
    <li>The interface, through which the customer asks the waiter to bring some food</li>
</ul>
<p>
    We could call these three elements like this, respectively:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>Customer</code> (class)</li>
    <li><code>Waiter</code> (another class)</li>
    <li><code>OrderProcessor</code> (the interface)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="interface-declaration-in-java">How does an interface declaration look like in Java?</h2>

<p>Let's look at an example, by following our previous analogy of the restaurant:</p>
<pre>
// interface declaration
interface OrderProcessor {
    // here we declare only the method (behavior)
    public void bringFood(String dishName);
}

// a class that implements the interface
class Waiter implements OrderProcessor {
    // the actual logic of the method (body of the method) is defined here
  	public void bringFood(String dishName) {
	    System.out.println("Brought " + dishName + " to customer");
    }
    // ... rest of the code omitted for brevity
}

// another class that can ask for food
class Customer {
    private String favoriteDish = "Fish and Vegetables";

	// ... other code omitted for brevity

    void askForFood(OrderProcessor orderProcessor) {
	    // the customer interacts with the interface OrderProcessor
        orderProcessor.bringFood(favoriteDish);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    This interface is called <code>OrderProcessor</code> and it defines the "bring food" behavior, which is declared as
    a method named: <code>bringFood</code>.
</p>
<p>This a very simple example; let's dive deeper into the intricacies of interfaces in Java.</p>

<p>There are two types of interface declarations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Normal interface declarations</em></li>
    <li><em>Annotation interface declarations</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
    In this article only the normal interface declaration is covered. Annotation interface declaration will be covered
    in a separate article.
</p>
<p>Letâ€™s see the structure of an interface declaration:</p>
<pre>
{InterfaceModifier} interface TypeIdentifier [TypeParameters] [InterfaceExtends] [InterfacePermits] InterfaceBody
</pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-InterfaceModifier" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>{InterfaceModifier}</code>
        </a> is one of:
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-9.html#jls-Annotation" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>Annotation</code>
        </a>, <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>abstract</code>,
        <code>static</code>, <code>sealed</code>, <code>non-sealed</code>, <code>strictfp</code>
    </li>
</ul>
