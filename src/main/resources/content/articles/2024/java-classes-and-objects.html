<h2>What are Java classes and objects?</h2>

<p>
    To put it simple, a <strong>Java class</strong> is a "form of classification". It is a concept from
    <em>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</em> that allows us to "classify" (or group together) a type of
    <em>object(s)</em> &mdash;another concept from OOP&mdash;. An <strong>object</strong> represents a specific instance
    of a class. With classes and objects we can represent real-world concepts and entities in our programs as well as
    their interactions.
</p>

<p>
    For instance, in a program called <em>ZooManager</em> we could have the following classes: <code>Animal</code>,
    <code>Cage</code>, <code>Food</code>, and <code>ZooKeeper</code>. Likewise, the specific animal, cage, food and
    zookeeper <em>instances</em> that are present in the Zoo we're managing would be the objects instantiated during
    the execution of the program. In this case, examples of instances would be <code>teo</code> (a tiger),
    <code>cage1</code> (a cage), <code>meat</code> (food), and <code>john</code> (a zookeeper).
</p>

<h3>How do we decide what classes to define in our program?</h3>

<p>
    Classes define common <em>properties</em> and <em>behaviors</em> for the objects they represent. For example, the
    <code>Animal</code> class would have the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>name</code></li>
    <li><code>energy</code></li>
</ul>

<p>and the following behaviors</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>move</code> (if an animal moves, it consumes energy, the <code>energy</code> property decreases)
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>eat</code> (if an animal eats, it recovers energy, the <code>energy</code> property increases)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    So, when we identify a collection of objects in our business domain that share the same properties and behaviors,
    we are usually in the presence of a class to be defined in our program. Sometimes it can be obvious, like
    knowing we'll need a class called <code>Animal</code> in our ZooManager program, but sometimes it's more difficult
    to identify when we would benefit from the definition of a class. As we gain experience throughout the years, as
    developers/software engineers, it becomes easier to identify each case.
</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>
    The simplest form of a class definition in Java you could find is this (<code>Animal</code> could have been any
    other name we define):
</p>

<pre>
class Animal {
}
</pre>

<p>
    But that class isn't very useful, is it? So, let's see everything we have in our power to declare and define our
    own classes.
</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>
    Let's use the chapter about classes from the
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html" target="_blank">
        Java Language Specification (JLS) for Java 21
    </a>
    to understand the anatomy of a class in Java.
    Notice you may want to check the
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/" target="_blank">
        JLS specific to your Java version
    </a>
    .
</p>

<p>Formally, this is the structure of a Java class:</p>

<pre>
{ClassModifier} class TypeIdentifier [TypeParameters] [ClassExtends] [ClassImplements] [ClassPermits] ClassBody
</pre>

<p>
    Where
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-ClassModifier" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>{ClassModifier}</code>
        </a>
        is one of: <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>abstract</code>,
        <code>static</code>, <code>final</code>, <code>sealed</code>, <code>non-sealed</code>, <code>strictfp</code>.
    </li>

    <li><code>class</code> is the Java keyword used to specify we're declaring a class.</li>

    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-3.html#jls-TypeIdentifier" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>TypeIdentifier</code>
        </a>
        is the name we want to give the class. In our previous example we used <code>Animal</code>.
    </li>

    <li>
        <!--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typographical_symbols_and_punctuation_marks-->
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-TypeParameters" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>[TypeParameters]</code>
        </a>
        is a collection of <em>types</em> we can define withing angle brackets (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>). For instance,
        <code>&lt;T&gt;</code>. See
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/index.html"

    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-ClassExtends" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>[ClassExtends]</code>
        </a>
        is the portion of the class declaration where we can specify, after the keyword <code>extends</code>, the class
        (if any) from which our class is a direct child (descendant, inheritor). For instance,
        <code>extends LivingBeing</code>.
    </li>

    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-ClassImplements" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>[ClassImplements]</code>
        </a>
        is the portion of the class declaration where we can list, after the keyword <code>implements</code>, the
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html" target="_blank">
            interfaces
        </a>
        (if any) whose behavior our class implements. For instance, <code>implements MovingBeing, Eater</code>.
    </li>

    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-ClassPermits" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>[ClassPermits]</code>
        </a>
        is used when the <code>sealed</code> modifier is specified, and it indicates, after the keyword
        <code>permits</code>, the other classes (if any) that are allowed to extend our class. For example,
        <code>permits Tiger, Ostrich, Bear</code>.
    </li>

    <li>
        and,
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-ClassBody" target="_blank"
           class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
            <code>ClassBody</code>
        </a>,
        <!--https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/html-->
        is the <em>body</em> of our class, within curly braces (&lcub;&rcub;). See next section.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Class body</h4>

<p>
    In short, this is the structure of the class body (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-ClassBodyDeclaration" target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        <code>{ClassBodyDeclaration}</code>
    </a>):
</p>
<pre>
{
    ClassMemberDeclaration
    InstanceInitializer
    StaticInitializer
    ConstructorDeclaration
}
</pre>
<p>
    Let's see what these elements are, along with some examples.
</p>

<h5>Members</h5>

<p>
    With <em>members</em> (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-ClassMemberDeclaration"
       target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        <code>ClassMemberDeclaration</code>
    </a>
    ), we refer to <em>fields</em> (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-FieldDeclaration" target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        <code>FieldDeclaration</code>
    </a>
    ) and <em>methods</em> (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-MethodDeclaration" target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        <code>MethodDeclaration</code>
    </a>
    ). These are the respective <em>properties</em> and <em>behaviors</em> that we were referring to initially.
</p>

<h6>Fields</h6>

<p>
    Fields are properties, attributes that characterize our classes, they hold the state of the objects created from
    our classes and are useful for storing the objects information during runtime.
</p>
<p>
    We saw already some examples of properties for our mentioned <code>Animal</code> class. Now, let's see how we can
    actually write that in our code. Let's enhance our <code>Animal</code> class with some fields:
</p>

<pre>
class Animal {
    String name;
    int energy;
}
</pre>

<h6>Methods</h6>

<p>
    Methods define the behavior of the objects, they specify what "actions" the objects can do during the execution
    of our program, they define the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" target="_blank">
        API
    </a>
    through which we (technically speaking, other objects) can interact with them. They can do two things: return
    information about the object, and/or modify it, that's it, modify the internal state of the object.
</p>

<p>
    Let's see how we can define the actions our <code>Animal</code> objects can do:
</p>

<pre>
class Animal {
    String name;
    int energy;

    void move() {
        energy--;
        System.out.println(name + " moved");
    }

    void eat() {
        energy++;
        System.out.println(name + " ate");
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
    In this example, the method <code>move</code> decreases the <em>energy</em> value and prints the name of the animal
    that moved (i.e.: <code>teo moved</code>).
</p>

<p>
    The method <code>eat</code> does the opposite: it increases the <em>energy</em> value, and also prints the name of
    the animal that ate (i.e.: <code>teo ate</code>).
</p>

<h5>Constructors</h5>

<p>
    So far, we've talked a lot about Java classes, but not so much about the objects.
</p>
<p>
    Just to make sure we understand the concept of <em>object</em>, if we were to make an analogy, we could say that
    <em>Woman</em> is a class, while <em>Ana</em> is an object. Similarly, <em>Man</em> is a class, and <em>John</em>
    is an object.
</p>
<p>
    Now, let's see how we can create objects in our programs. Java provides us with something called
    <em>constructors</em> (
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-8.html#jls-ConstructorDeclaration"
       target="_blank"
       class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0">
        <code>ConstructorDeclaration</code>
    </a>
    ). They are a "special" piece of code inside the body of our class that allow us to <em>instantiate</em>,
    <em>create</em> objects from a class definition.
</p>

<p>
    This is the structure of the constructor. Pay special attention; it looks similar to a method, but it lacks return
    type:
</p>
<pre>
    {ConstructorModifier} ConstructorDeclarator [Throws] ConstructorBody
</pre>

<p>
    But, it can be better understood with an example, so let's see it in action in our <code>Animal</code> class.
</p>
<pre>
class Animal {
    String name;
    int energy;

    Animal(String name) {   // <--Constructor added
        this.name = name;
        energy = 100;
    }

    void move() {
        energy--;
        System.out.println(name + " moved");
    }

    void eat() {
        energy++;
        System.out.println(name + " ate");
    }
}
</pre>

Here we've created a constructor that accepts a <code>name</code> argument and assigns it to the <code>name</code>
field. It also initializes the <code>energy</code> field with a value of <code>100</code>.

<h3>Putting it all together</h3>

<p>Let's see an example where we apply all the knowledge we've learned.</p>

<h3>Could we implement our programs entirely without classes?</h3>

<p>
    Certainly. We don't need, technically speaking, to create our own classes to implement a business logic. But by
    creating classes...
